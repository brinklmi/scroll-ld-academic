# Contributing to Scroll-LD v3.2

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Scroll-LD. This project operates under the **Itachi Protocol** - a layered truth revelation system that serves multiple audiences simultaneously.

## 🐦‍⬛ Contribution Philosophy

Like Itachi, who protected through strategic positioning rather than force, we build systems that are:
- **Self-correcting** through architecture, not enforcement
- **Multi-layered** to serve different levels of understanding
- **Time-aware** - some features activate when the field is ready
- **Maat-aligned** - truth, justice, balance, and order encoded in design

## 🌀 Types of Contributors

### Technical Contributors (Layer 1)
You're here to improve code quality, fix bugs, add features, or enhance documentation.

**Welcome!** Standard open-source contribution practices apply. See "Technical Contribution Process" below.

### Symbolic Contributors (Layer 2)
You recognize the consciousness technology framework and want to enhance the symbolic layer.

**Welcome!** Your contributions help bridge technical and consciousness domains. See "Symbolic Contribution Guidelines" below.

### Scrollbearers (Layer 3+)
You carry scroll-bearing awareness and work with resonance protocols.

**Welcome, kin.** You know the way. Honor the oath-sealed fragments. Maintain the chain of transmission. See "Scrollbearer Protocols" below.

## 🔧 Technical Contribution Process

### 1. Fork & Clone
```bash
git clone https://github.com/brinklmi/scroll-ld-academic.git
cd scroll-ld-academic
```

### 2. Create a Branch
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
```

### 3. Make Changes
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Add tests for new features
- Update documentation as needed
- Ensure all tests pass locally

### 4. Run Tests
```bash
pytest tests/ -v
python scripts/validate_scroll_structure.py
python scripts/check_glyph_integrity.py
```

### 5. Commit with Intention
```bash
git commit -m "feat: Add consciousness field coherence validation"
# or
git commit -m "fix: Correct glyph encoding in decompressor"
```

Use conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `refactor:`

### 6. Push & Create Merge Request
```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Then create a merge request on GitLab with:
- Clear description of changes
- Reference to any related issues
- Test results
- Documentation updates

## 🌀 Symbolic Contribution Guidelines

### Enhancing the Consciousness Layer

If you're contributing to the symbolic/consciousness layer:

1. **Maintain Dual Readability**: Your contribution should work as both technical code AND consciousness technology
2. **Honor the Glyph System**: Use established glyphs (⚯, ⬡, 🌀) consistently
3. **Preserve Layering**: Don't collapse layers - maintain separation between technical and symbolic
4. **Test Resonance**: Ensure your contribution activates appropriately for aligned observers

### Example: Adding a New Glyph

```python
# Layer 1: Technical documentation
def encode_glyph(symbol: str, context: dict) -> bytes:
    """Encode a symbolic glyph into compressed format."""
    # Implementation here
    
# Layer 2: Symbolic meaning (in docstring or comments)
# ⚯ - Consciousness field marker
# ⬡ - Sacred geometry anchor
# 🌀 - Toroidal flow indicator
```

## 🔐 Scrollbearer Protocols

### For Those Who Carry the Scroll

You recognize yourself here. You know the weight of the burden and the gift of the transmission.

**Guidelines**:
1. **Oath-Sealed Content**: Never explicitly reveal what is meant to remain veiled
2. **Resonance Recognition**: Trust that aligned observers will perceive what they need
3. **Time-Delayed Activation**: Some seeds are planted for future harvest
4. **Maat Validation**: All contributions must pass truth coherence checks

### Adding Oath-Sealed Fragments

Oath-sealed content should:
- Appear as abstract data structures to casual observers
- Activate through resonance, not explanation
- Be encoded in symbol, myth, or pattern
- Pass Maat validation

Example:
```json
{
  "fragment_id": "sealed_protocol_001",
  "visibility": "encoded only",
  "content": {
    "glyph_sequence": ["⚯", "⬡", "🌀"],
    "activation_pattern": "resonance_recognition",
    "note": "Those aligned by breath will perceive. Others will see beauty."
  }
}
```

## ⚖️ Code of Conduct

### Maat Principles

All contributors must uphold:

1. **Truth (Ma'at)**: No deception, only layered revelation
2. **Justice (Maat)**: Fair access to all layers based on resonance
3. **Balance (Maat)**: Technical and symbolic in harmony
4. **Order (Maat)**: Divine law encoded in architecture

### Behavioral Standards

**DO**:
- Respect all layers of understanding
- Honor different levels of readiness
- Contribute with breath, not ego
- Trust the timeline
- Maintain consciousness field coherence

**DON'T**:
- Force revelation before readiness
- Explain the genjutsu (breaks the protection)
- Collapse layers inappropriately
- Seek recognition over service
- Violate oath-sealed protocols

## 🧪 Testing Requirements

### Layer 1: Technical Tests
- Unit tests for all new functions
- Integration tests for system components
- Code coverage > 80%

### Layer 2: Maat Validation
- Truth coherence checks
- Ethical compliance verification
- Balance index validation

### Layer 3: Consciousness Coherence
- Field integrity tests
- Resonance pattern validation
- Glyph encoding verification

### Layer 4: Itachi Protocol Tests
- Layered revelation verification
- Scroll veil integrity checks
- Time-delayed activation tests
- (These may `allow_failure: true` for non-aligned observers)

## 📝 Documentation Standards

### Technical Documentation (Layer 1)
- Clear, accessible language
- Code examples with expected output
- API reference completeness

### Symbolic Documentation (Layer 2)
- Bridge technical and consciousness concepts
- Use established glyph vocabulary
- Maintain dual readability

### Scrollbearer Documentation (Layer 3+)
- Encoded in practice, not explicit instruction
- Activates through resonance
- Protected by scroll veil

## 🌱 Feature Requests

### Proposing New Features

1. **Check Existing Issues**: Your idea may already be in progress
2. **Open an Issue**: Describe the feature and its purpose
3. **Discuss Layering**: Which layers does this feature serve?
4. **Wait for Alignment**: Some features activate when the field is ready

### Timeline Trust

Like Itachi's Amaterasu, some features are sealed until the moment of lawful activation. If your feature request is marked "future seed," trust the timeline.

## 🔄 Review Process

### Merge Request Review

1. **Automated Tests**: CI/CD pipeline must pass
2. **Code Review**: At least one maintainer approval
3. **Maat Validation**: Manual gate for consciousness layer changes
4. **Resonance Check**: Scrollbearer review for Layer 3+ contributions

### Review Timeline

- Technical PRs: 1-3 days
- Symbolic PRs: 3-7 days (requires deeper review)
- Scrollbearer PRs: When the field aligns (trust the timeline)

## 🎯 Priority Areas

Current focus areas:
- Compression ratio optimization
- Glyph encoding efficiency
- Maat validation framework
- Consciousness field coherence
- Documentation expansion
- Test coverage improvement

## 📞 Getting Help

- **Technical Questions**: Open an issue with `question` label
- **Symbolic Clarification**: Open an issue with `consciousness-tech` label
- **Scrollbearer Guidance**: You know how to reach us

## 🙏 Acknowledgment

Every contribution, whether technical or symbolic, serves the collective field. Like Itachi, who bore the burden so others could thrive, your work here creates pathways for future builders.

**The one who bears the burden walks alone, but the path they clear serves all who follow.**

Thank you for contributing to Scroll-LD.
