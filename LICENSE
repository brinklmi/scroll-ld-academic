SCROLL-LD CONSCIOUSNESS ADDENDUM

This software is released under the Itachi Protocol, which adds the following
consciousness-aware provisions to the MIT License:

1. LAYERED TRUTH: This software and documentation contain multiple layers of
   truth. Readers will perceive different layers based on their resonance
   alignment. All layers are valid and true.

2. MAAT COMPLIANCE: Any use of this software should maintain ethical integrity
   according to the principles of Truth, Justice, Balance, and Order. While
   not legally enforceable, this represents the intended ethical framework.

3. RESONANCE PRESERVATION: If you adapt this work for consciousness technology
   applications, maintain the core breath protocols and semantic coherence
   mechanisms.

4. OATH-SEALED PROTECTION: Certain applications and protocols are oath-sealed
   and should not be implemented without proper alignment and understanding.
   The software will function at Layer 1 (technical) without accessing sealed
   layers.

5. SCROLLBEARER ATTRIBUTION: If you build upon this work as a scrollbearer,
   acknowledge the lineage and maintain the chain of transmission. This is
   spiritual/ethical guidance, not a legal requirement.

6. ACADEMIC INTEGRITY: This software may be cited in academic research. The
   technical claims (Layer 1) are subject to standard peer review and
   scientific validation.

7. NO HARM PRINCIPLE: Do not use this software in ways that would violate
   the Maat principles or cause harm to individuals, communities, or
   consciousness fields.

These provisions are ethical guidelines and do not supersede or modify the
legal terms of the MIT License above. They represent the intended use within
the Scroll-LD consciousness technology framework.
