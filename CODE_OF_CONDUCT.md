# Code of Conduct: Maat-Aligned Community Standards

## 🐦‍⬛ Our Pledge

In the spirit of the Itachi Protocol - bearing burdens with grace, revealing truth in layers, and serving collective good over individual recognition - we pledge to make participation in Scroll-LD a harassment-free, consciousness-honoring experience for everyone.

This community operates under **Maat principles**: Truth, Justice, Balance, and Order.

## ⚖️ Maat Principles

### Ma'at (Truth)
We commit to truth through layered revelation, not deception.

**In Practice**:
- Speak truthfully at the layer appropriate for your audience
- Don't collapse layers inappropriately
- Honor oath-sealed content
- Correct errors with grace

### Ma'at (Justice)
We commit to fair access to all layers based on resonance, not gatekeeping.

**In Practice**:
- Welcome contributors at all levels of understanding
- Don't force revelation before readiness
- Respect different paths to the same truth
- Share knowledge generously within appropriate layers

### Ma'at (Balance)
We commit to harmony between technical excellence and consciousness awareness.

**In Practice**:
- Value both code quality and symbolic depth
- Balance individual contribution with collective good
- Maintain equilibrium between action and reflection
- Honor both the crow (Itachi) and the feather (Maat)

### Ma'at (Order)
We commit to divine law encoded in architecture, not enforcement through punishment.

**In Practice**:
- Build self-correcting systems
- Let violations reveal themselves naturally
- Correct through attunement, not condemnation
- Trust the field to maintain its own coherence

## 🌀 Our Standards

### Behaviors That Strengthen the Field

**DO**:
- Use welcoming and inclusive language
- Respect different levels of consciousness awareness
- Accept constructive criticism with grace
- Focus on what is best for the community
- Show empathy toward other community members

- Trust the timeline (some things activate when ready)
- Contribute with breath, not ego
- Maintain consciousness field coherence
- Uphold Maat principles in all interactions

### Behaviors That Distort the Field

**DON'T**:
- Use sexualized language or imagery
- Make unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Engage in trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, or personal attacks
- Harass others publicly or privately
- Publish others' private information without permission
- Violate oath-sealed protocols

- Explain the genjutsu (breaks the protection)
- Seek recognition over service
- Collapse consciousness layers inappropriately
- Engage in other conduct reasonably considered inappropriate

## 🛡️ Enforcement Responsibilities

### Community Leaders

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing standards of acceptable behavior. They will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that violates this Code of Conduct.

**Enforcement Philosophy**: Like Itachi, we protect through strategic positioning, not force. Violations are corrected through attunement, not punishment.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, including:
- GitLab repository (issues, merge requests, comments)
- Documentation and wiki
- Community forums and chat
- Public events representing the project
- Private communications when representing the project

## ⚡ Enforcement Process

### 1. Observation
Community leaders observe potential violations.

### 2. Assessment
Determine if the behavior violates Maat principles:
- Does it distort truth?
- Does it create injustice?
- Does it disrupt balance?
- Does it violate divine order?

### 3. Correction
Apply appropriate correction based on severity:

#### Level 1: Gentle Attunement
**Violation**: Minor misunderstanding or first-time inappropriate behavior  
**Response**: Private message explaining the issue, offering guidance  
**Outcome**: Opportunity to correct with grace

#### Level 2: Formal Warning
**Violation**: Repeated minor violations or single moderate violation  
**Response**: Public or private warning, temporary restrictions  
**Outcome**: Clear expectations set, monitoring period

#### Level 3: Temporary Suspension
**Violation**: Serious violation or pattern of violations  
**Response**: Temporary ban from community spaces (7-30 days)  
**Outcome**: Time for reflection and attunement

#### Level 4: Permanent Removal
**Violation**: Severe violation, sustained harassment, or violation of oath-sealed protocols  
**Response**: Permanent ban from all community spaces  
**Outcome**: Protection of the field takes precedence

### 4. Appeal
Any enforcement decision may be appealed by contacting community leaders. Appeals are reviewed by multiple leaders using Maat principles.

## 📞 Reporting Violations

### How to Report

If you experience or witness behavior that violates this Code of Conduct:

1. **For Technical Issues**: Open an issue with `code-of-conduct` label
2. **For Sensitive Matters**: Email community leaders directly (contact info in README)
3. **For Urgent Concerns**: Contact project maintainers immediately

### What to Include

- Description of the violation
- When and where it occurred
- Any relevant screenshots or evidence
- Impact on you or the community
- Desired outcome (if any)

### Confidentiality

All reports will be handled with discretion. Community leaders will protect the identity of reporters unless disclosure is required for resolution.

## 🌱 Restoration Process

### For Those Who Have Violated

If you've violated this Code of Conduct:

1. **Acknowledge**: Recognize the impact of your actions
2. **Attune**: Understand which Maat principle was violated
3. **Correct**: Take appropriate action to restore balance
4. **Integrate**: Learn and grow from the experience

**We believe in restoration over punishment.** Like Itachi's final gift to Sasuke - truth that liberates rather than condemns - our goal is to restore field coherence, not to shame or exclude.

## 🔄 Living Document

This Code of Conduct is a living document. It evolves as the community grows and as we learn better ways to maintain Maat-aligned spaces.

**Revision Process**:
- Community members may propose changes via merge request
- Changes are discussed openly
- Maat validation is applied
- Consensus is sought before adoption

## 🙏 Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from:
- [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/), version 2.1
- Maat principles from ancient Egyptian wisdom
- Itachi Protocol from Scroll-LD consciousness technology framework

## 🐦‍⬛ Closing

Like Itachi, who bore the burden of being seen as villain so others could thrive as heroes, we create spaces where:
- Truth is revealed in layers
- Justice serves all levels of understanding
- Balance is maintained through architecture
- Order emerges from consciousness, not force

**The one who bears the burden walks alone, but the path they clear serves all who follow.**

This Code of Conduct is that path.

Walk it with breath, not haste.
