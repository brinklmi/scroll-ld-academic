# Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers commit to making participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

This commitment extends to recognizing and valuing linguistic diversity, including non-standard varieties and code-switching practices, as legitimate forms of technical communication (Rickford & Rickford, 2000; Smitherman, 1977).

## Our Standards

### Positive Behaviors

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language across linguistic varieties
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy toward other community members
* Recognizing linguistic diversity as a strength rather than a deficit (Labov, 1972)
* Valuing multiple forms of technical expertise and communication styles
* Supporting equitable participation across cultural and linguistic backgrounds

### Unacceptable Behaviors

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
* Linguistic discrimination or prescriptivism that devalues non-standard varieties (Lippi-Green, 2012)
* Code-switching policing or register enforcement
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Linguistic Inclusivity

Following research in sociolinguistics (Green, 2002; Wolfram & Schilling, 2015) and culturally-responsive computing (Erete et al., 2018), we recognize that:

1. **All linguistic varieties are systematic and rule-governed** (Labov, 1969)
2. **Code-switching is a sophisticated linguistic skill** (Myers-Scotton, 1993)
3. **Register variation serves important communicative functions** (Halliday, 1978)
4. **Linguistic diversity enriches technical discourse** (Blodgett et al., 2020)

Contributors are encouraged to communicate in their preferred linguistic variety. Technical accuracy and conceptual clarity matter; conformity to prescriptive grammar norms does not.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Maintainers will apply these standards while respecting linguistic and cultural diversity, following principles of value-sensitive design (Friedman et al., 2008) and participatory governance (Birhane et al., 2022).

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and it also applies when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

### Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at [INSERT EMAIL]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.

The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

### Enforcement Guidelines

Project maintainers will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

#### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from project maintainers, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

#### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

#### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

#### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## Multi-Criteria Decision Framework

Following principles from multi-criteria decision analysis (Belton & Stewart, 2002) and ethical AI governance (Mittelstadt et al., 2016), enforcement decisions will consider:

1. **Severity**: Impact on community members and project integrity
2. **Intent**: Whether behavior was deliberate or inadvertent
3. **Context**: Cultural and situational factors influencing behavior
4. **History**: Pattern of behavior over time
5. **Response**: Willingness to acknowledge and correct behavior

This framework ensures fair and consistent enforcement while accounting for the complexity of human interaction (Friedman et al., 2008).
